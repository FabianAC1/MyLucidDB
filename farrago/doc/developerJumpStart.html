<h1>Getting Started With Farrago</h1>

This document provides instructions on how to build and run Farrago.

<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

So far, the Fennel kernel only runs on Linux and Windows.  This means
to actually store data in Farrago, you have to be running
one of these operating systems.  However, the Java portion is likely
to run on other platforms where JDK 1.4 is available.  You can
use it to test parsing, validation, optimization, and the metadata
aspects of DDL, as well as some very simple queries againts foreign data
accessible via Java.

<p>

So, if you're working on a task that doesn't require Fennel, you can
do the development anywhere.  If you need Fennel, then you have a few
options:

<ul>

<li>use your own Linux or Windows box if you have one

<li>use one of the Sourceforge compile farm machines (Fennel has
been successfully tested on some of them)

<li>work on porting Fennel to your platform!

</ul>

<h2>Important Windows Note</h2>

If you are using Windows, please read the <a
href="cygwinSetup.html">Cygwin setup instructions</a> before going any
further.  

<h2>Get the Source Code</h2>

Currently, the only way to build Farrago is to get the source from
Perforce.  (If you just want to take a look-see through the codebase,
you can use <a href="http://apoptosis.dyndns.org:8080/open/dev/farrago/">
p4web</a>.)  If you're new to Perforce, you might want to read the
official <a
href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.022/manuals/boilerplates/quickstart.html">
Perforce Quick Start</a>.  If you don't already have p4.exe, download
the appropriate binary from 
<a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/loadprog.html">
Perforce</a> (you only need the client, not the server).

<p>

There are a number of ways to configure Perforce depending on the
platform (on Windows through the GUI, on Unix through environment
variables or a .p4env file).  The essential information you need to
provide is:

<ul>
<li>P4PORT=apoptosis.dyndns.org:1666
<li>P4USER=your-sourceforge-user-name
<li>P4CLIENT=your-user-name.your-hostname
</ul>

In order to make changes, you'll need to send your username to the
Farrago project admin and request write access.  If you don't have a
Sourceforge account yet, <a href="http://sf.net/account/register.php">
go get one</a>.  For read-only clients (like if you just want a
snapshot of the latest code), use the predefined username "guest" (the
server license has a user limit, but there's no limit on the number of
clients, so feel free to create multiple workspaces on as many
machines as needed).

<p>

Once you've got Perforce set up, run p4 client (or edit your default
clientspec from P4WIN).  You need to map the following views:
<pre><code>
//open/dev/thirdparty/...
//open/dev/fennel/...
//open/dev/farrago/...
//open/dev/saffron/...

</code></pre>

All of these should be mapped to a common root corresponding to //open/dev
(you can call it whatever you like on your local filesystem, but we'll
refer to it as dev in this and other developer docs).

<p>

Finally, run p4 sync to get all the source files and thirdparty
distributions into your client workspace.  This will take quite a while
because some of the thirdparty distributions are large, and
apoptosis.dyndns.org is limited by DSL upload speed (regardless of the
girth of your pipe).

You should also make sure you have <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4">JDK 1.4</a> or higher installed,
with JAVA_HOME set to the JDK installation root.

<p>

If you will be building Fennel, now is the time to make sure you have
the correct versions of the required build tools such as autoconf.
The file dev/fennel/INSTALL (and dev/fennel/INSTALL.mingw for Windows)
has more information.  You can ignore the instructions for building
STLport, Boost, and Fennel manually, since the next step is going to
take care of all of that automatically.

<h2>Initial Build</h2>

For the first build in a new sandbox, there's a lot of
one-time setup that needs to be done, possibly including building some
of the third-party components from source.  This process is automated
by the script dev/farrago/initBuild.sh.  Change to the
dev/farrago directory and run the initial build as follows:

<pre><code>
initBuild.sh --with-fennel

  or

initBuild.sh --without-fennel

</code></pre>

If you're building without Fennel, this should be fairly quick; with
Fennel it will take quite a bit longer.  If all goes well, you'll be
left with a complete Farrago build for your platform.  Otherwise,
you'll need to dig into the script and its output to see what's going
wrong.  If you can't figure it out, ask for help on the <a
href="#Feedback">farrago-developers mailing list</a>.  You should
probably include the last 100 lines of build output including the
error.

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

The initial build script takes care of setting some necessary
environment variables internally, but once it completes they are left
unset.  For subsequent runs and builds of Farrago, you will need to
make sure these are set.  Scripts are provided for this purpose.  You
can run them automatically from a login script such as .bash_profile,
or run them manually before working with Farrago:

<pre><code>

source dev/fennel/fennelenv.sh dev/fennel
source dev/farrago/farragoenv.sh dev/thirdparty

</code></pre>

As usual, you only need the Fennel script if Fennel support is
enabled.  Don't execute these scripts directly; you must use . or
source in order for the environment variable settings to take effect
for subsequent commands.

<h2>Incremental Builds</h2>

Once you already have a working build, updating to the latest code
requires following these steps:

<ol>

<li>
p4 sync.  You'll probably want to examine the output to see what has
changed (or you can ignore it and blindly carry out the rest of the
steps unconditionally).

<li>
If anything under dev/thirdparty/... has changed, cd to that
directory and run make.  New thirdparty components and upgrades to new
versions are fairly rare.

<li>
If anything under dev/fennel/... has changed (and you're building
with Fennel support), cd to that directory and run make.  In very rare
cases, you may need to make clean first, but that should be a last
resort.  Upgrades to thirdparty components relied on by Fennel may
require further action such as running configure again and rebuilding
them; if you subscribe to the developer mailing list, there should be
instructions posted whenever this is required.

<li>
If anything under dev/saffron/... has changed, cd to that directory
and run ant.  This build is very quick, so an "ant clean" first never hurts.

<li>
cd to dev/farrago and run "ant test" to make sure you'll be
working from a good build (WARNING: this will rebuild your catalog
automatically, destroying any data in your Farrago database)

</ol>

<h2>Catalog Dump</h2>

At any time, you can get a dump of the catalog by running "ant
exportCatalog"; the output will be an XMI file in
dev/farrago/catalog/xmi/FarragoCatalogExport.xmi.
This can be useful for debugging the effects of DDL
execution.

<h2>Catalog Backup/Restore</h2>

The "ant createCatalog" task (invoked automatically by "ant test")
creates a backup of the initial catalog (and database if Fennel is
enabled).  If your catalog gets corrupted (which will be a possibility
on crash until we get Fennel to store the catalog), you can recover
with "ant restoreCatalog".  This is a lot faster than "ant
createCatalog" (which is another way to get back to a good state).

<h2>Interactive SQL</h2>

You can execute interactive SQL from a command-line via the
open-source JDBC <a href="http://sqlline.sourceforge.net">sqlline</a>
project.  Just run the sqlline script from dev/farrago.  (You can
ignore the UnsupportedOperationException thrown by the JDBC driver
during startup.)  After connecting, try "select * from sales.emps;"
(but if you disabled Fennel, don't be disappointed when the result set
comes back empty).

<p>

If you prefer using a GUI, try the <a
href="http://www.isqlviewer.com">iSQL</a> project instead.  To start
the GUI, run "ant isql".  A service named Farrago is predefined
automatically from dev/farrago/isql/Farrago.service.  

<h2>Tracing</h2>

Tracing based on the standard <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html#package_description">java.util.logging
facility</a> is controlled by the file
dev/farrago/trace/FarragoTrace.properties, which is generated when
the catalog is created.  You can make modifications to this file; they
won't be overwritten during regeneration.  However, comments cannot be
preserved during regeneration, so don't bother.  Normally, trace output
is written to dev/farrago/trace/FarragoTrace.log, but you can
override this in the properties file.  The default trace level for all
loggers is CONFIG.

<p>

The timestamp of the trace configuration file is checked once per
second; whenever it changes, the new configuration is applied
automatically, so there's no need to restart the database.  (TODO:
make this configurable, since that's not always desirable.)

<p>

Farrago classes use the standard logger naming scheme (logger name
matches fully-qualified class name, so for detailed catalog tracing of
the JDBC driver, add net.sf.farrago.jdbc.level=FINE).  However,
Saffron and Fennel don't use java.util.logging API directly, so they
have custom logger naming schemes:

<ul>

<li>add net.sf.farrago.saffron.level=FINE to turn on all Saffron tracing (no
further discrimination is available)

<li>add net.sf.farrago.fennel.level=FINE to turn on all Fennel tracing
(probably more than you want!)

<li>add net.sf.farrago.fennel.FennelDbHandle.level=FINE to trace just
the commands sent to the Fennel API (not their implementation)

<li>add net.sf.farrago.fennel.xo.level=FINE to trace tuples processed
by TupleStreams (you can also select individual stream types by name,
e.g. net.sf.farrago.fennel.xo.FennelSortingStreamDef.level=FINE)

<li>some Fennel classes provide further tracing discrimination (TBD)

</ul>

<h2>Unit Testing</h2>

Please read the <a
href="api/net/sf/farrago/test/package-summary.html#package_description">
test package overview</a> for details.

<h2>Debugging</h2>

Run "ant jswat.sqlline" or "ant jswat.isql" to use the <a
href="http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat">JSwat</a> debugger for
execution of interactive SQL commands.  For sqlline, input/output is
performed through the JSwat Output pane at the bottom left of the
screen.  The junitDebug script can also be used to debug one unit test
at a time.  If you want to use another debugger, the jswatDebug ant
macro definition in dev/farrago/buildMacros.xml might be helpful as
a template for passing the right startup information.  Also, as part of a
successful build, the full classpath is always dumped to the file
dev/farrago/classpath.gen.

<h2>Coding</h2>

Please read the incredibly brief <a href="codeStyle.html">code
style</a> doc.  The <a href="bestiary.html">bestiary</a> may also be
helpful.
