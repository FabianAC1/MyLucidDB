<h1>Using a Private Branch</h1>

This document explains how to use a Perforce private branch for
Farrago development.  A private branch allows you to check in code
whenever you want without worrying about breaking someone else's
build.  Only when you integrate to a shared tree do your changes
become visible to anyone else.  This means you can save changes
frequently (reducing the amount of code lost should your machine
crash) and test experimental changes across multiple machines without
having to copy files around.

<h2>Creating Your Branch</h2>

Before creating a private branch, you need to decide on the shared
tree from which your private branch will sprout.  The correct shared
tree is wherever you have been checking out code already.  The most
common case would be <code>//open/dev/...</code>, which we'll use in
the examples below.

<p>

Next, you need to decide where your branched files will live in the
Perforce depot.  Standard policy is to create your branch under 
<code>//open/users/...</code>.  Never create your branch under a
shared tree, otherwise everyone who maps that shared tree will
accidentally map your private branch as well.  So, if your Perforce
user name is pmarlowe, you might use
<code>//open/users/pmarlowe/dev/...</code> to branch from
<code>//open/dev/...</code>.

<p>

Your new branch also needs a name.  A good name in this case would be
<code>dev_to_pmarlowe</code>, which specifies the branch origin
(<code>dev</code>), branched location (<code>pmarlowe</code>), and
branching direction (later on it will become apparent why this naming
convention is important).

<p>

To actually create the branch, issue a command like:

<pre><code>
p4 branch dev_to_pmarlowe
</code></pre>

Edit the <code>Description</code> field to give more details on the
purpose of your branch, and define the branch view mapping:

<pre><code>
View:
        //open/dev/thirdparty/... //open/users/pmarlowe/dev/thirdparty/...
        //open/dev/saffron/... //open/users/pmarlowe/dev/saffron/...
        //open/dev/fennel/... //open/users/pmarlowe/dev/fennel/...
        //open/dev/farrago/... //open/users/pmarlowe/dev/farrago/...
</code></pre>

Defining the branch view is pretty much like defining a client view,
except that the right hand side references the depot rather than the
client.  It's a good idea to include everything you think you're going
to need, because changing the branch definition later can lead to
trouble.  For example, don't try to economize on disk space by leaving
out thirdparty and trying to share the local copy from another branch;
getting this right and keeping it working as things change is more
trouble than it's worth.

<h2>Request Access Rights</h2>

Unfortunately, you won't be able to use the branch you just created
unless you have access rights to the branched location, which you
probably don't.  Send mail to the <a
href="mailto:perfecthash@users.sf.net">Farrago administrator</a>,
providing the name of the branch, and wait for a reply.

<h2>Perform Initial Integration</h2>

Once you have the required access rights, the next step is to edit
your client view to add your branched location.  So, you might end up with
something like:

<pre><code>
View:
        //open/dev/thirdparty/... //pmarlowe.pi/dev/thirdparty/...
        //open/dev/saffron/... //pmarlowe.pi/dev/saffron/...
        //open/dev/fennel/... //pmarlowe.pi/dev/fennel/...
        //open/dev/farrago/... //pmarlowe.pi/dev/farrago/...
        //open/users/pmarlowe/dev/thirdparty/... //pmarlowe.pi/pmarlowe/thirdparty
        //open/users/pmarlowe/dev/saffron/... //pmarlowe.pi/pmarlowe/saffron
        //open/users/pmarlowe/dev/fennel/... //pmarlowe.pi/pmarlowe/fennel
        //open/users/pmarlowe/dev/farrago/... //pmarlowe.pi/pmarlowe/farrago
</code></pre>

This would place your local <code>pmarlowe</code> directory as a
sibling to your local <code>dev</code> directory.  This structure is
up to you to decide; something deeper becomes necessary when you have
multiple private branches corresponding to multiple shared trees.

<p>

Now, before performing the initial integration (populating the private
branch in the depot), sync all files which are to be branched so that
you are branching from the latest version.  In this example:

<pre><code>
p4 sync //open/dev/...
</code></pre>

will do the trick.

<p>

Now, tell Perforce to do the integration:

<pre><code>
p4 integrate -t -b dev_to_pmarlowe
</code></pre>

The <code>-t</code> is redundant here but becomes important later, so
get in the habit of including it whenever you invoke <code>p4
integrate</code>; otherwise you'll have nasty problems when file types
change.

<p>

The <code>p4 integrate</code> command doesn't really do all of the
work; it just tells Perforce what you're planning to do.  To complete
the branching in your client workspace:

<pre><code>
p4 resolve -am
</code></pre>

At this point, you should be able to build, run, and test under the
local <code>pmarlowe</code> directory just created by <code>p4
resolve</code>.  Once that looks good, check in (this won't affect
anyone else):

<pre><code>
p4 submit
</code></pre>

The checkin comment should indicate 

<ul>

<li>the branch creation

<li>the trees involved

<li>the change number you branched from

</ul>

Your private branch is now open for business.

<h2>Propagating Other Developers' Changes from the Shared Tree</h2>

Without a private branch, the first thing you would probably do before
starting a new task would be to execute <code>p4 sync</code> to start
from the latest code.  With a private branch in place, there are a few
extra steps:

<ol>

<li><code>p4 sync</code> as usual.  Make sure you sync both the shared
tree and your private branch location, otherwise you'll experience
unpleasant anomalies later.

<li><code>p4 integrate -t -b dev_to_pmarlowe</code>

<li>Run the above integrate command again to make sure it says nothing
needs to be done.  Sometimes during a big integrate real warnings will
be buried in all the success messages.  If you get a warning, use the
warning text and <code>p4 help resolve</code> to try to figure out
what you need to do.

<li><code>p4 resolve -am</code>.  If you have made changes in your
private branch, they may conflict with changes coming in from the
shared tree.  In that case, use the normal conflict resolution process.

<li>Run resolve again to make sure it says nothing needs to be done.

<li>At this point, you may want to build and run tests in your private
branch to make sure you aren't polluting your private branch with
someone else's breakage.  Make sure you are working in the correct
local tree (a good idea is to set up multiple shell launchers in your
desktop, one for each branch, and arrange for the shell window title
to display the branch location).  If tests fail, use <code>p4
revert</code> to undo the integration.  If you trust the shared tree,
you can skip this step.

<li><code>p4 submit</code> to update your private branch with the
integration before starting on your own changes or integrating
subsequent changes from the shared tree (it's not a good idea to mix).
This submit does not affect anyone else, so you should always do it
sooner rather than later.  A good convention for the checkin comment
is <code>integrate dev_to_pmarlowe@XXX</code> where <code>XXX</code>
is the change number you synced and integrated from.

</ol>

<h2>Propagating Your Changes Back to the Shared Tree</h2>

OK, now you've done some development, submitted changes to your
private branch, and are ready to publish those changes to the shared
tree for everyone else to see.  Before doing anything else, it's a
good idea to do another propagate in the forward direction and merge
the latest changes into your private branch (just as it's a good idea
to sync and resolve before submit when working without a private
branch).  After that, the steps for the real checkin are almost the
same as above:

<ol>

<li><code>p4 sync</code>.

<li><code>p4 integrate -t -r -b dev_to_pmarlowe</code>.  The
<code>-r</code> tells Perforce to go in the reverse direction.  Since
the branch name was chosen to describe the forward direction,
reverse integration will be from <code>pmarlowe</code> to
<code>dev</code>, which is what we want.

<li>Run the above integrate command again to make sure it says nothing
needs to be done.

<li><code>p4 resolve -am</code> and resolve any conflicts.  If you
followed the advice above about doing another forward integration,
there shouldn't be any unless some other doofus just checked in during
this window.

<li>Run resolve again to make sure it says nothing needs to be done.

<li>At this point, you definitely want to build and run tests in the
shared tree to make sure your changes have been properly merged (even
if you didn't get any merge conflicts).  If tests fail, the best
approach is to debug and then <code>p4 revert</code> to back out of
the integration before fixing the problem (in your private branch).

<li>Once all is well, <code>p4 submit</code>; this is the only real
checkin from the perspective of other developers, so your checkin
comment should probably summarize all of the changes made in your
private branch (and maybe list the relevant change numbers).

</ol>

<h2>More to Explore</h2>

Did all of the notes above scare you a bit?  Good.  Branching should
never be undertaken lightly, even in a source-control system with
excellent support for it such as Perforce.  If you carefully adhere to
the above procedures, you should have very few problems.  However, if
things get sticky, it's a good idea to make sure you understand the
underlying concepts well before seeking a resolution.  A good resource
is the <a
href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.032/manuals/p4guide/09_branching.html">
branching chapter</a> from the official Perforce User's Guide.  The
links at the end have some more info on general branching theory.
Also, if an integration should go haywire, remember that nothing is
made permanent until <code>p4 submit</code>.  So if you want to back
out and restart the whole procedure, just use <code>p4 revert</code>
and then <code>p4 opened</code> to make sure that all files have been
successfully reverted.
