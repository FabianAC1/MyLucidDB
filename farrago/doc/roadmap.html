<h1>Farrago Roadmap</h1>

<hr>

This document sketches the medium-term release plan for the Farrago
project.  It's light on details, which will be filled in once there
are owners for tasks.  Some of the Farrago-level tasks may require
one or more subtasks at the level of the Fennel kernel.  The current
task list can be viewed from

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=30032&group_id=80183&func=browse">
Sourceforge's Task Manager
</a>.

The intention of defining a roadmap is to have some basis for task
definition, prioritization, and sense of progress.

<hr>

<h2>Developer-only Releases</h2>

Currently, the project is in "developer only" mode where it makes no
sense for anyone other than a developer to even look at it.  However,
during this time, we'll still do regular releases just to have some
consistent code snapshots out there for prospective developers to play with.

<hr>

<h2>TPC-W Release</h2>

The first non-developer release should contain just enough to demonstrate
a working, integrated system that can execute a reasonable subset of
SQL via JDBC.  In order to have clear exit criteria for this release,
the 
<a href="http://www.tpc.org/tpcw">TPC-W benchmark</a>
has been selected as an integration test because it

<ul>

<li>has a <a href="http://www.ece.wisc.edu/~pharm/tpcw.shtml"> Java
implementation</a> available which matches our target architecture
well (in particular, it's servlet-based, so it does not require a
remote JDBC driver)

<li>uses fairly simple SQL

<li>as a benchmark, can be used to drive an initial tuning effort

<li>as a standard, is something we'll want to get around to eventually anyway

</ul>

Note that the intention is to use TPC-W as a sample application, not
to get any meaningful performance numbers (if the initial numbers
aren't terrible, it means something isn't actually working yet!).  If
something (e.g. a subquery) is the only thing that doesn't work, we'll
just disable it and declare victory.

<hr>

<h2>SQL92 Functionality and Performance Releases</h2>

Once the basics are dealt with, we can move on to the tricky stuff.
The goal here is to move towards competitiveness and compatibility
with existing systems.  These will most likely be split up into
multiple releases (possibly in parallel):

<ul>

<li>
view definition and rewrite

<li>Information Schema views into catalog

<li>JDBC metadata support

<li>advanced datatype support

<li>access control

<li>referential integrity

<li>advanced SQL expression support (with commonly used expressions in
kernel rather than Java)

<li>ODBC driver and optimized JDBC client driver, both of which may
bypass Java altogether on the server side for result set retrieval

<li>performance tuning

<li>hash join (acquire if possible)

<li>merge sort (to replace btree-insertion sort above; acquire if possible)

<li>storage management, backup/restore, etc.

<li>blobs

<li>distributed transaction support

<li>Fennel persistence for MDR

<li>resource balancing

<li>heterogeneous queries

</ul>

<h2>Diversification Releases</h2> 

If the project survives through to
this point, then many paths (e.g. federation, clustering, analytics,
hardware acceleration, etc.) open up.  However, it's a bad idea to
start on any of these before the basics are in place.
