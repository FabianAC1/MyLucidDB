<h1>Farrago Project FAQ</h1>

<h2>What's with the name?</h2> 

See the <a
href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=farrago">dictionary</a>.
But that's not the <a
href="http://www.quinion.com/words/topicalwords/tw-far1.htm">whole
story</a>.

<h2>Does the world really need another open-source DBMS?</h2>

Perhaps surprisingly, yes.  Most of the offerings I've seen are fine
for running a website but inadequate for enterprise use.  In addition,
the most popular open-source systems are burdened with legacy code and
architecture.  There are many ways to go wrong, especially if the goal
is something as banal as a quick buck, mindshare, or a dumping ground
for an unsuccessful commercial product.  The basics of relational
database technology are mature, well-known, and non-proprietary;
despite its name, Farrago is all about taking the time to create a
maintainable, high-quality implementation that can eventually replace
even the most heavyweight closed-source products (OK, that and
achieving world peace).  Novelty is a non-goal.

<h2>Isn't Java slow?  Doesn't that mean Farrago can't possibly compete
with systems implemented entirely in C/C++?</h2>

Careful attention has been paid to keep Java out of the most important
data processing paths.  Where Java is used (mostly at the metadata and
optimization level, with an auxiliary role in execution), its
performance is acceptable.

<h2>Under what license is Farrago distributed?</h2>

The Farrago code which puts everything together is licensed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</a> 
(GPL would be preferable, but is incompatible with usage of Java).  
MDR components are licensed under the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/sunpublic.php">
Sun Public License</a>.  MonRG is under the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpl.php">
Common Public License</a>.  JavaCC is under the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">BSD License</a>.

<h2>Some older Saffron documentation describes many
deviations from standard SQL (e.g. null semantics, Java type system
dependencies, aggregation).  Does this mean Farrago SQL is
non-standard also?</h2>

No.  The core of Saffron is an extensible optimizer which is agnostic
about these issues.  Farrago supplies its own SQL-conformant
optimization rules when it instantiates the optimizer.  The other
parts of Saffron (such as the Java precompiler) aren't used for SQL
processing.

<h2>Are you insane?  Why are you even attempting this?</h2>

<b>John Sichi's personal answer:</b>

Maybe.  Because.  Ok, at least three reasons:

<ul>

<li>The giants are out there.  They're not windmills.  Someone's got
to take them on.

<li>I have built significant portions of four different DBMS products
in my for-hire career.  Each time, I ended up having to walk away from
a lot of code, usually due to changes in company direction.  I need
closure.

<li>It seems that every few years someone gets an idea for a new DBMS
which is going to solve some niche problem, thus avoiding direct
competition with the big boys.  (I've been involved with a couple of
these.)  What happens is that 90% of the effort gets burnt on building
all the infrastructure required for a generic DBMS, and only 10% on
the proprietary solution.  This is counter-productive.  So, even if
Farrago never achieves its most ambitious goals, its architecture
should still make it a useful platform for this kind of effort.
</ul>

<h2>Why a jackalope for the mascot?</h2>

The wily jackalope combines the speed of a jackrabbit with the fluid
grace and complex headgear of an antelope, which seems appropriate
for a hybrid Java/C++ system.  In addition, the jackalope symbolizes
a vision beyond the mundane reality seen by others (and is also
reputed to be surprisingly savage when cornered).
