/**
 * A synchronization primitive which allows producer and a consumer to use the
 * same {@link java.nio.Buffer} without treading on each other's feet.
 *
 * <p>This class is <em>synchronous</em>: only one of the producer and consumer
 * has access at a time. There is only one buffer, and data is not copied.
 *
 * <p>The byte buffer is fixed in size. The producer writes up to the maximum
 * number of bytes into the buffer, then yields. The consumer must read all of
 * the data in the buffer before yielding back to the producer.
