<!-- ====================================================================== -->

This file contains the definitions of queries (SQL or LURQL) used internally by
Farrago.  These will never need to be localized.  We use the resgen
mechanism as a convenience: it allows us to maintain queries in
readable form instead of embedded with ugly escaping in Java code,
with early binding between invoking code and query name.
(Parameters are still late-bound by name; it would be nice to make
them early-bound also.)
