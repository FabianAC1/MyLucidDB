Contains the CWM interfaces generated by MDR, plus some custom
implementation classes.

<hr>

This package is generated by the build (along with
its subpackages).  The build calls
MDR to map
the  <a href="http://www.omg.org/cwm">CWM model</a>
into Java classes.  In addition, certain interfaces have custom
implementation classes (these have class names ending in Impl).
