Top-level package containing all Farrago subpackages.

The diagram below illustrates the dependencies among Farrago subpackages:

In general, higher-level packages depend on lower-level packages,
but not vice versa (e.g. almost everything depends on resource, and
parser and type depend on catalog).  No lateral dependencies are
allowed (e.g. fennel and saffron are mutually independent), except
where explicitly shown (ddl and parser).  In this context,
dependency means early binding; that is, the higher-level package
references the lower-level package at compile time.

<p>

The cwm and fem packages are special because they contain generated code,
but also contain implementation classes.  The dependencies are
for the two kinds of code are very different, and so are shown separately
(the cwm and fem packages in the lower left represent the generated code;
the cwmImpl and femImpl packages in the upper right represent the
implementation classes).

<p>

TBD: dependencies on packages like java.sql, and split up query
package into opt/stmt.

<p>

Dependencies are checked via the <a
href="http://innig.net/macker">macker</a> tool.  Currently, this is
done manually, but will eventually there will be an automated checkin
monkey for enforcement, so that when macker gets mad, he'll send you
email and give you a piece of his mind.  Dependency definitions are in
<a href="http://apoptosis.dyndns.org:8080/open/farrago/src/macker.xml">
//open/farrago/src/macker.xml</a>.

<p>

Note that late binding is allowed to violate the layering.  For
example, the util layer defines the {@link
net.sf.farrago.util.FarragoAllocation} interface.  The jdbc layer
defines class {@link net.sf.farrago.jdbc.FarragoJdbcStatement}, which
implements FarragoAllocation, and passes an instance to {@link
net.sf.farrago.util.FarragoCompoundAllocation}.  When the
FarragoCompoundAllocation is closed, it calls back via the interface,
meaning at runtime, code in the util layer ends up calling code in the
jdbc layer.
