Provides generic partial implementations for the interfaces in {@link
net.sf.farrago.namespace}.  Namespace data wrapper developers should
use these as bases whenever possible.  This saves initial development
time and also makes wrappers less brittle: whenever new interface
methods are added, default implementations can also be added to the
abstract bases, causing them to be inherited by existing wrappers
automatically.
