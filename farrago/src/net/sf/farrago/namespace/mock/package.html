<body>

Defines a mock Farrago namespace implementation which generates
non-persistent table data for use in testing activities such as
benchmarking.  At the moment the generated data is very simple: a
single NOT NULL column of primitive integral type containing all 0's,
with the number of rows set as an option when the table is created.
