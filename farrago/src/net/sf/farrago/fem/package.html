Contains the Farrago extension model classes generated by MDR.

<hr>

This package is generated by the build (along with its subpackages).
The build calls MDR to map the Farrago extension model (TODO: design
doc link) into Java classes.  In addition, certain interfaces have custom
implementation classes (these have class names ending in Impl).
