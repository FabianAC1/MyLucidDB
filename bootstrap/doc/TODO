In no particular order:

- should builds depend on each other?  E.g. saffron would trigger
  farrago and aspen, fennel would trigger farrago and aspen, farrago
  would trigger aspen.  It should be possible to piggy back the
  triggered builds onto the success child builds, reducing build
  time.  Means that farrago/initBuild.sh would need to take a param
  that prevents it from rebuilding fennel and saffron.

- figure out C++ unit test reporting

- is there a way to publish currentbuildstatus.txt when build is
  skipped due to no changes in perforce?  without this you get "next
  build: 17:30:22" long after that time

- mechanism for embedding P4 password into config.xml?  how about Ant?
  Right now the startcc.sh script sets $P4PASSWD and this only works
  because perforce.eigenbase.org's guest account has no password (it accepts
  anything).  Means we're sending the Disruptive perforce guest
  password to perforce.eigenbase.org.  Needs more thought: maybe we can specify the
  password in a properties file and tell CC where the file is.  File
  wouldn't be checked in Perforce.

- modify P4.java to use counters instead of hokey time-based
  changelist updates -- see Julian's e-mail

- HTML-ize installation docs and provide them as an alternative to the
  current build docs (once this thing can bootstrap itself)
