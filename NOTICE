The code in this repository is provided 100% unencumbered via the ASL 2.0
from DynamoBI Corporation.  This code is based on the work of numerous 
companies and individuals through the collaboration and Copyright/IP 
sharing framework that existed at Eigenbase Foundation (a non profit).

Eigenbase released the entire codebase directly to the public under the
terms of the GPLv2 but also had separate, full copyright sharing agreements
with companies deeply involved at Eigenbase (SQLstream, LucidEra, DynamoBI)

In short, all companies had joint copyright on each others Eigenbase code
and could license as they see fit, without accounting to the other (including
commercial closed source licensing).  The IP was NOT shared (meaning each 
owns a portion) but rather joint (each owns it all, without account to other).

All IP in this repository is provided to the public, at large, under 
the terms of the ASL 2.0 by either:

a) The copyrights/IP DynamoBI has obtained from it's contractual / legal 
agreement with Eigenbase (JDA) and the corresponding agreements between other
individuals/companies and Eigebnase (JCAs/JDAs)
-or-
b) Direct ASL licensing / CLAs (any code commits after ASL relicense early 2012)

Eigenbase JDAs, and JCAs or Apache CLAS cover 100% of the project code provided
in this repository are available here: https://github.com/dynamobi/luciddb-legal

(NOTE: Certain 3rd party code/src patching is contained and is not 
covered via this ASL2.0 grant)
